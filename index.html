    <h2>
      The world is not dangerous because of those who do harm but because of
      those who look at it without doing anything

        "A whole new world; a dazzling place I never knew." These mellifluous
        words from the soundtrack of Aladdin say it all. The world, however
        absurd, dangerous, or harsh, is a fine place to live. The world is
        special because of its inhabitants. Cherish our world and protect it
        from destruction. Our planet is our home and we are its caretaker. Here
        are some world quotes that fill you with intrigue and fascination. If
        you think about it, our world is a rich tapestry of cultures, languages,
        landscape, colors, and people. Technology has helped to diffuse
        boundaries, whether physical or cultural. We call our world a "global
        village" because though we belong to different countries, we are
        essentially a single race.
